# local-judge-template-cp
local judge template for competitive programming

<hr>

this is the template that i wrote for my local judge (aka stress tester).<br>
it can generate random test cases and stress tests (compare results) for competitive programming

<hr>

**note:**
- the code i wrote was not cleaned, there are many messy stuff that i left without really cleaning and, which made my code hardly readable (because i dont have time to clean it :<)
- the only code i have cleaned is the JUDGE_v2 `sinhtest.cpp` file
- and yes, i am planning to clean it some time (when i have enough time), which i will re-write the whole code to make it shorter and more readable!
